The article presents a way to describe and determine some of the main quantum effects by means of semantic networks. Such a description can be used to create a conceptual model for MAS in the field of nanotechnology. Semantic networks are defined in the object-oriented simulation language UML2 SP. It has been shown that the representation of scientific models using semantic networks is as effective as mathematical descriptions.
