The double-slit experiment is a demonstration that light and matter can display characteristics of both classically defined waves and particles. In 1927, Davisson and Germer demonstrated that electrons show the same behavior.

## 1. Matematical description
Let the particle get from the source $$x_{0}$$ to the point of the screen $$x_{1}$$ by two paths a and b.  
Then the transition is described by the vron function

$$|\psi\rangle = A_{a}|a\rangle + A_{b}|b\rangle ,$$

here $$A_{a}=c_{a}e^{i \varphi_{a}}$$, $$A_{b}=c_{b}e^{i \varphi_{b}}$$ are a complex numbers and $$c_{a}$$, $$c_{b}$$ are a real numbers.  
The probability density of detecting a particle at the point $$x_{1}$$ is determined by the formula

\begin{equation}
\langle\psi|\psi\rangle = \mid A_{a}\mid ^{2} + \mid A_{b}\mid ^{2} + (A_{a}^* A_{b}+A_{a}A_{b}^*) =\\  
c_{a}^2 + c_{b}^2 + 2c_{a}c_{b}\cos(\varphi_{a}-\varphi_{b})
\end{equation}

The integral of the absolute squares of the amplitudes is one:

\begin{equation}
\int_0^{2\pi} \langle\psi|\psi\rangle d\varphi = 1, \\  
\end{equation}  
where $$\varphi = \varphi_{a}-\varphi_{b}$$.  
Then  
\begin{equation}  
2\pi c_{a}^2 + 2\pi c_{b}^2 + 2c_{a}c_{b}[\sin(2\pi)-\sin(0)] =  \\  
2\pi (c_{a}^2 + c_{b}^2) = 1. \\  
\end{equation}  
If $$c_{a} = c_{b} = c$$ then
$$\begin{align*}
c = \pm \frac{1}{2\sqrt\pi}
\end{align*}$$.


## 2. Semantic net description
An ontology of the double-slit experiment is depicted in Fig.1

![Image](double-path.png)
Figure 1 - The ontology of the experiment  

The ontology is a similar an ontology of classical case but has  'Mix' class. The class inhered 'move_to_x1' operation from both 'A' and 'B' classes. In this case, we has conflict of the names. This conflict resolve as the quantom rule. The 'Mix' class has 'w1' and 'w2' attributes for the quantom rule.  
The 'Composite' frame define abstract 'Doble-path experiment' concept. The 'Node' frame define concrete experiment and determine the installation construction.  

One step of the experiment is depicted in Fig.2.

Figure 2 - Single experiment  

The particle created and put to 'x0' point. Object2 (experimental install) send 'set_w(phi)' message to 'Mix' class wich set both 'w1' and 'w2' attributes. Further, Object2 create an 'a' object, where resolve the names conflict. Next step is execute 'move_to_x1' operation that put the particle to 'x1' point on screen.
This process execute in 'Run' operation many times for get statistics.  
We wach that here has  elements metaprogramming.  

## 3. Experiments result
Typical result of the experiment is depicted in Fig.3 (kn = 10 measurements for each value $$\varphi$$).

Figure 3 - Experiment result  

Classical case is depicted in Fig.4. Classical experiment hasn't 'Mix' class and probabilite is a sum square amplitudes.

Figure 4 - Classical experiment result  

Same  result can be get if 'A' and 'B' classes has different name of the operations (for instance, move_to_x1 and move_to_x2).  

## 4. Software
The complete code is here [https://github.com/vgurianov/qm/software/slits.py](https://github.com/vgurianov/qm/blob/master/software/slits.py).  

Both classes A and B describe a paths from $$x_{0}$$ to $$x_{1}$$.  
The 'Mix' class describe wave function $$|\psi\rangle$$. The function has 'wa' and 'wb' atributes. It are coeficents of the wave function. In the function '__init__' operation resolve the conflict names 'move_to_x1'.  
The 'Node' class simulate a experimental device.  
Let n is count of measurements then the standard deviation is  
\begin{equation}  
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n(n-1)}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}(\Delta x_{i})^2 },  
\end{equation}  
where  $$\Delta x_{i}=x_{i}-\overline{x}$$, $$\overline{x}$$ is the sample mean. The confidence interval is $$\Delta_{\sigma}x = t_{n,\alpha}\sigma$$, where  $$t_{n,\alpha}$$ is a Student's t distribution with n âˆ’ 1 degrees of freedom, $$\alpha=0.95$$ (the 95th percentile). We use the function  stats.t.ppf((1.0 + 0.95)/2, n-1) from the 'stats' package.  
Then $$x = \overline{x} \pm \Delta_{s}x$$.

In other denotes, the standard deviation is

$$\sigma = \sqrt{\operatorname {Var}(x_{ar}) / (n-1)}$$,  
where $$\operatorname {Var}(x_{ar})$$  is  variance and n is count of measurements.  
The confidence interval is   
$$\Delta_{\sigma}x = \sigma\overline{x}/\sqrt{n}$$
