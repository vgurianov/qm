## Wavefunction and wavefunction collapse
Wave function analog is a class, Fig.1.  This figure shows a frame named Frame1, which is rendered as a "Class" UML-element. The Frame1 is assigned the concept "Wave function". This concept has the designation ID (ID may not match Frame1).  
Wave function collapse analog is to run constructor of the class and create an object, i.e. instance of the class.

We separate wave function collapse and measurement over a quantum system. In our opinion, the collapse of the wave function can occur in nature without any measurements.
The measurement procedure is shown in Fig.2

The measurement results with the collapse of the wave function will be various. However, the measurement results after the collapse will be unchanged. If we now repeat the measurement, we will always get the same value of the measured property.
