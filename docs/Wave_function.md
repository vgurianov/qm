## Wavefunction and wavefunction collapse
Wave function analog is a class, Fig.1.  This figure shows a frame named Frame1, which is rendered as a "Class" UML-element. The Frame1 is assigned the concept "Wave function". This concept has the designation ID (ID may not match Frame1).  
Wave function collapse analog is to run constructor of the class and create an object, i.e. instance of the class.

We separate wave function collapse and measurement over a quantum system. In our opinion, the collapse of the wave function can occur in nature without any measurements.
The measurement procedure is shown in Fig.2

The measurement results upon collapse of the wave function can vary, but the outcome after collapse will remain the same. If we were to repeat the measurement, we would obtain the same value every time for the measured property.
